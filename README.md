# SocialAPP

Loyal Chain is a JavaFX project similar to a social network app that allows users to create secured personal accounts and interact with other users.

This application allows people who use it to connect with others by sending and accepting friend requests. Once connected, they can chat with friends
and keep in touch with them through the app's messaging feature. 

Once a user makes a friend request, other users can accept or decline the request. If the request is accepted, they become friends and they can start chatting. 
The interface of this social app is designed to be simple and intuitive, making it easy for users to navigate and use the app. 

Overall, this social app is a great platform for people who want to connect with other people and make new friends.
With its user-friendly interface and messaging capabilities, it provides a convenient way for people to keep in touch and communicate with their friends.
